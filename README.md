This is the most challenging project so far for me. It connects to a article page, specifically - https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?sort=PubDate&year=2020.

It searches for a certain type of article given by the user on amount of pages also given by the user. It then gets the content of those articles and saves it to a correspoding folder and file.
For example matching article from page 1 will be saved to folder called "Page1" and in that folder a file named after the title of the article will be saved.
That file will contain that articles content.
